        Planting disease-resistant hybrid corn is the primary strategy to avoid common rust. Timely planting of corn early during the growing season
        may help to avoid high inoculum levels or environmental conditions that would promote disease development.

        Gray leaf spot can be prevented by using resistant corn hybrids, convetional tillage where appropriate, and crop rotation. Rotation to crops
        other than corn for at least one year in low risk fields may minimize the severity of GLS.

        The most economical and effective way to avoid Northern Corn Leaf Blight is by planting disease-resistant corn hybrids. Scouting the field during
        or before pollination can also avoid damage of NLB by controlling the disease before it develops. Crop rotation also helps reduce the favorable environmental conditions for NLB.

    <string name="prevent_faw">
        Rotating corn with other non-host crops such as sunflower and beans may be useful to minimize the invasion of fall armyworms. Regular field monitoring also proves effective by identifying
        the presence of the pest early before the impact on corn field increases.

        To prevent or minimize impacts of aphid in corn field, during the growth of the crop, remove weeds from within and outside the crop. Inspect crops
        regularly to monitor the presence of aphids. If aphids are present, destroy leaves that are heavily infested. After harvest, collect and burn the
        remains of crops. There are varieties of corn that are resistant to aphids; these have leaf compounds which have a defensive role against the aphid.

        Any weed control method that helps eliminate grasses will reduce the number of potential stalk borer egg-laying sites, reducing the probability of stalk
        borer damage the next year. Control of grassy weeds is important to keep stalk borer problems from increasing year to year.

        The most effective way to prevent corn flea beetles is to purchase seeds that has been treated with systemic insecticides.

        Preventative measures should be taken before planting if scouting reveals a presence of white grubs in a field. To scout for grubs, dig and break up soil before planting.
        Sampling efforts should target grassy areas within and around fields.

    <string name="prevent_ww">
        Scouting before planting is a good preventive measure against wireworm. One method to easily identify the presence of wireworms is by using a bait trap one week or earlier prior to planting.
        Some traps may not detect wireworms if their population is low so it is still important to scout after the corn plants emerges.
