    <string name="name_gls">
        Gray Leaf Spot
    </string>

    <string name="cause_gls">
        Fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis
    </string>

    <string name="facts_gls">
        Gray leaf spot is favored by wet humid weather. Additionally, it is favored in situations with reduced tillage
        and continuous corn. Airborne spores are spread locally and regionally from corn debris.
    </string>

    <string name="symptoms_gls">
        The symptoms of gray leaf spot are Usually first noticed in the lower leaves. Initially, lesions of gray leaf
        spot begin as a small dot with a yellow halo. Lesions will elongate over time running parallel to the veins
        becoming pale brown to gray and rectangular in shape with blunt ends. These lesions can be described as having the appearance of “matchstick.”
        Leaves appear grayish in color due to the presence of fungal spores.
    </string>

    <string name="mgmt_gls">
        Management of gray leaf spot include tillage, crop rotation and planting resistant hybrids. Fungicide may be needed to prevent significant loss when plants are infected early
        and environmental conditions favor disease. Lesions may eventually coalesce killing the leaves.
    </string>




    <!-- ...................................Northern Corn Leaf Blight................................... -->

    <string name="name_nlb">
        Northern Corn Leaf Blight
    </string>

    <string name="cause_nlb">
        Fungus Exerohilum turicum
    </string>

    <string name="facts_nlb">
       If lesions begin early (before silking), crop loss can result. Late infections may have less of an impact on yield.
        NLB is favored by wet humid cool weather.
        Spores of the fungus that cause this disease can be transported by wind long distances from infected fields. Spread within and between fields locally also relies on wind blown spores.
    </string>

    <string name="symptoms_nlb">
        The tan lesions of northern corn leaf blight are slender and oblong tapering at the ends ranging in size between 1-6 inches.
        Lesions run parallel to the leaf margins beginning on the lower leaves and moving up the plant. They may coalesce and cover the entire leaf.
        Spores are produced on the underside of the leaf below the lesions giving the appearance of a dusty green fuzz.
    </string>

    <string name="mgmt_nlb">
       Northern corn leaf blight can be managed through the use of resistant hybrids. Additionally, timely planting can be useful for avoiding conditions that favor the disease
    </string>




    <!-- ...................................Common Rust................................... -->
    <string name="name_cr">
        Common Rust
    </string>

    <string name="cause_cr">
        Fungus Puccinia sorghi
    </string>

    <string name="facts_cr">
       Late occurring infections have limited impact on yield.
        Disease development is favored by cool, moist weather (60 – 70 o F)
    </string>

    <string name="symptoms_cr">
       Symptoms of common rust often appear after silking. Small, round to elongate brown pustules form on both leaf surfaces and other above ground parts of the plant.
        As the pustules mature they become brown to black.
        If disease is severe, the leaves may yellow and die early.
    </string>

    <string name="mgmt_cr">
      The use of resistant hybrids is the primary management strategy for the control of common rust.
      Timely planting of corn early during the growing season may help to avoid high inoculum levels or environmental conditions that would promote disease development.
    </string>
