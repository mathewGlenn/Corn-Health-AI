            There are two known natural enemies that are effective in controlling army worms: parasitoid wasps and trichogramma wasps.
            These wasps lay their eggs inside the eggs of moths such as the army worm. This prevents the eggs of army worms from
            hatching into a caterpillar and it also breaks the lifecycle of the army worm, effectively preventing them
            from reproducing.

        Many predators and parasites attack corn leaf aphids. Predators such as the lady bird beetles consume them. Several parasitic
        wasps sting corn aphids and lay eggs inside their bodies and then these eggs will later hatch into parasitic larvae, consuming
        the aphids from the inside.

        Among the predators that affects the larvae are the insidious flower bug; green lacewings; and several lady bird beetles.
        One parasitic wasps that can destroy corn borers is the trichogramma. This wasp seeks out and lay their egg inside corn borer eggs.
        The eggs of trichogramma would later hatch and destroy the corn borer eggs, preventing them from reproducing.

        Natural enemies of corn flea beetles include braconid wasps and tachinig flies. In both cases, the larval stage eats flea beetles,
        while the adult stage feeds on nectar and pollen. Toads also eat flea beetles and their pupae.

        The primary predators of white grubs are birds. Spiders, mites, predatory and parasitic beetles, wasps, and flies are also
        documented as natural enemies of white grubs.

        Wireworms have few natural enemies. Some ground beetles and rove beetles will feed on wireworms. The larvae
        of stilleto flies are also known as predators of wireworms.
