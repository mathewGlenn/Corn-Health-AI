        If around 50% of corn plants in the field are showing symptoms of gray leaf spot
        prior to tasseling, the plant is susceptible and can be controlled with fungicides.
        Available fungicides that can be applied include products with active ingredient
        CHLOROTHALONIL or PYRACLOSTROBIN.

    <string name="chem_control_cr">
        Common rust can be controlled with fungicides but the timing is extremely important. For the best
        results, application should be done as soon as the symptoms are observed. This will prevent the disease
        to spread on more healthy leaves. Available fungicides that can be applied include products with active ingredient
        AZOXYSTROBIN, CHLOROTHALONIL, DIFENOCONAZOLE+PROPICONAZOLE, TEBUCONAZOLE, PYRACLOSTROBIN, TEBUCONAZOLE+TRIFLOXYSTROBIN.

    <string name="chem_control_nlb">
        The infection of northern leaf blight usually begins around the time of silking and this is the right time
        to apply fungicide. Timely application can greatly minimize impact on yield. Application is only practical
        if the disease is severe and widespread. Available fungicides that can be applied include products
        with active ingredient DIFENOCONAZOLE+PROPICONAZOLE or MANCOZEB.

        During the pollen-shedding of corn, the corn aphids may interfere with the process of pollen-shading if
        the insects are abundant on the tassels due to their secretion of sticky honeydew. If the condition is severe, pesticides
        can be applied to prevent further aphid invasion. The following pesticides are available to be applied:
        DIAZINON, FIPRONIL, LAMBDA-CYHALOTHRIN, LAMBDACHYHALOTHRIN + THIAMETHOXA, MALATHION, PYMETROZINE, or CHLOTHIANIDIN
